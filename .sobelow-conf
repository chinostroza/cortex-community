  # Config.HTTPS: HTTPS is terminated at the reverse proxy (nginx) in production.
  # The application itself runs on HTTP internally behind the proxy.

  # Traversal.FileModule: File path in claude_cli_reader.ex comes from a fixed
  # module attribute (@credentials_file_path), not user input.
  #
  # XSS.HTML: page_controller.ex interpolates only:
  #   - Application.spec/2 (OTP app version, internal)
  #   - Integer stats (requests_total, success_rate, counts — not XSS vectors)
  #   - render_workers/2 output (worker.name and worker.type are HTML-escaped)
  # All values are internal system data, not user-supplied input.
